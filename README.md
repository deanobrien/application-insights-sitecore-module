 - Show a list of all exceptions happening on a given instance and their frequency

 - Group exceptions by ProblemId and then by InnerMostMessage

 - Track exceptions over time to see when they began or at what times during the day they occur

 - View logs from as far back as the moment you start tracking them
 
 - Extend to track any application using application insights
